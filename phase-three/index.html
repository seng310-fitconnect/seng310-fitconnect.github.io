      <p class="lead">Based on the low-fidelity mockup created during the phase II using Balsamiq, several features have been since incorporated using the high-fidelity tool - Adobe XD for phase III. The transition from low-fidelity to high-fidelity mockup, aims to enhance user experience, along with responsive and transitive functions, making the prototype an ideal working solution to the FitConnect mobile-based application. In terms of specifications, the font used for display is Avenir Next, as based on reviews and experience, the font stands out to have better readability on computer and mobile screens. Since this application is part of the University of Victoria health program, the university colour palette and themes have been used throughout the prototype.</p>

        <h2>Requirement: <span class="text-muted">The application needs to provide a secure and safe platform for participants to communicate with their peer volunteer without providing too much personal information.</span></h2>
        <p class="lead">The application only shows other users the pictures that you’ve posted and your first name, gender, age, program, fitness goals, favourite activities, and any additional interests. These are basic details necessary to facilitate good matches, and leaves the user to be as specific as they wish. Matches only occur when both parties have consented to communication by mutually “liking” each other. The in app chat is secure and provides a button in the top right corner of the chat to report users should they make them uncomfortable. These design requirements remained the same as the previous prototype. Added in the latest prototype is the ability to unmatch with people that you’ve matched with. This allows for people to remove people who they think would not fit with their goals. It also promotes a safe and secure platform, since it allows users to restrict their matches if they have any second thoughts.</p>

        <p class="lead">UVHS staff are able to coordinate with volunteers and set up a meeting time with them through the app. This is different than previous phases, which were through email. This further aids UVHS staff in their task of filtering bad volunteers. Once UVHS staff has determined that the volunteer is a fit for the program, the volunteer will begin to be able to match with users in the app.</p>

        <p class="lead">Like in the previous prototype, a matches page is accessible under the home button. Participants and volunteers are able to press “thumbs up” or “thumbs down” to indicate if they would like to match with their volunteer/participant. If the user presses thumbs up, the person they liked enters the potential match list. If the user dislikes the person, they will no longer appear in the matches page. As per previous prototype, users are able to set up profiles with details including their gender, age, program, fitness goals, favourite activities, and any additional interests.</p>

        <p class="lead">As in the previous prototype, users may sign up for FitConnect as a volunteer or participant in the sign up form. If the user signs up as a volunteer, UVHS staff will contact them through the app and set up an appointment to make sure they are a good fit for the program. In the previous prototype, scheduling was left to email. However, the latest prototype provides coordination in the app instead, which improves the simplicity of the process. Making the prototype more accessible will in turn help boost participation in the program.</p>

        <h2>Requirement: <span class="text-muted">Volunteers need to know how to to appropriately help participants.</span></h2>
        <p class="lead">Volunteers are able to view a participant’s gender, age, program, fitness goals, favourite activities, and interests, as per the previous prototype. This allows volunteers to find users they believe they can help the most, and whose goals align best with theirs. Volunteers are given chat functionality once a match occurs, allowing for them to further enquire as to the user’s goals and how to best help them. Volunteers need to complete training on signup, which is done by the UVHS staff setting up appointments with the volunteers. Once training is complete, the volunteer receives an email that confirms their account is active. The volunteer is then able to start matching with the participants. This functionality is the same as the previous prototypes, however, only the volunteer’s ability to match and see other users is limited, rather than their ability to login.</p>

They are organized into volunteer and participant tabs, like the previous prototype. The UVHS staff are able to set up appointments by pressing "manage" on a user and selecting the "schedule appointment" button. The admin is then able to schedule a date for the meeting. The user will be notified of the meeting date by email, like the previous prototype, but also will see it in the app. This allows the staff to set up and coordinate applications and screening appointments, and allows volunteers to better track their appointments and communicate their availability.</p>

After meetings with volunteers and them completing training, admins can approve volunteers. This restriction isn't enforced by the app so that admins have manual control. The UVHS staff will be able to remove users they feel violate the rules or won't be appropriate for the program.
